Welcome to my personal web page!

I’m a Robert and Sara Lumpkins Posdoctoral Fellow in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics, University of Notre Dame, where I’m working with <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~yzhang10/">Yongtao Zhang</a>. 

I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Brown University, advised by <a href="https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/shu/">Chi-Wang Shu</a>. 

Previously, I obtained a master in Mathematics at Michigan Technological University, advised by <a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~yyang7/">Yang Yang</a>, and a bachelor in Petroleum Engineering at China University of Petroleum (East China).
