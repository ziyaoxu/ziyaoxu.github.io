Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Binghamton University. I work on numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs).

Previously, I was a Robert and Sara Lumpkins Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Notre Dame. I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Brown University, where I was advised by Professor <a href="https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/shu/">Chi-Wang Shu</a>.
